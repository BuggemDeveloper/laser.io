         Hey, it's me Dave the comment.
         What, am I a joke to you??
         You're not gonna even say hi?
    
         Oh, boo hoo, why did I have to be
         a comment? I could've been a <p>
         a <b> or even a <title>! But my
         personal favorite is <meta>. I'm
         going out with a <meta> element
         today.

         Hang on?

         I saved the website!! Because I am
         the commit that republished the web
         page. I'm a hero!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
